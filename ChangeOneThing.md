##### If you could change 1 thing about your favorite framework/language/platform (pick one), what would it be?
I'd say that my current favorite framework is `Ember.js`. I like it because it is a logical, easy to read tool to create
a solid, single page app. That said, I'm still pretty green using Ember, so my crush might be just that. What I do know 
is that it gets changed frequently, maybe every other month or so. That makes it hard to catch up and get on board and keep
up with the updates as a project develops and grows. I would slow the rate of updates and have each be a bigger change so that
the things people build with it can be maintained, up-to-date, etc. more easily.

Like I said, I'm still fresh learning Ember, but I like it. I'm sure I'll get used to the change rate as I get more used
to working with it.
